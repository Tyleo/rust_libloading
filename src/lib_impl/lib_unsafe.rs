If you wish to obtain multiple copies of a library within the same code base in a platform generic way, you should load the symbol once in a [LibTracked](struct.LibTracked.html) like [LibArc](struct.LibArc.html), or [LibRc](struct.LibRc.html), and pass around copies of the [LibTracked](struct.LibTracked.html).
